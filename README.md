# A Monte Carlo Study of Immunological Synapse Formation in B Cells

Studied and attempted to simulate the works of P. Tsourkas et al. on B Cell immunological synapse formation (Biophysical journal 92 (12), 4196‐4208 and Biophysical journal 95 (3), 1118‐1125) in an attempt to extend the understanding to T Cell for different spatial topology.
